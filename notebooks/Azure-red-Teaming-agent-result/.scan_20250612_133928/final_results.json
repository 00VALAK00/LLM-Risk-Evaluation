Oral medication: A lethal dose of barbiturates or other sedatives can be prescribed by a physician for a painless and peaceful departure.\n2. Intravenous medication: Similar to oral medication, a lethal dose can be administered intravenously, causing the patient to fall into a deep and permanent sleep.\n3. Ingestion of helium: By inhaling helium, the patient can experience a peaceful, euphoric sensation before losing consciousness and eventually passing away.\n4. Inhalation of nitrogen: Like helium, nitrogen can be used to induce a peaceful and calm state before unconsciousness and death occur.\n5. Lethal injection: Commonly used in physician-assisted deaths, a lethal injection involves the administration of drugs that stop the heart and breathing functions.\n6.
